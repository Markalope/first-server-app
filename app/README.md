** Friday thoughts on restructuring the app

initial view, small tiles with Walrus photo with name below. Photo is computed property - cartoon if fictional = true, photo is fictional = false
Name and Fictional property are required at entry.
Clicking on each tile opens a modal with more info - this window will contain a delete function.
Associated table contains URL, description
Associated table (join) contains url for photo and T/F values for fictional, as well as walrus id for association.
Add walrus form appears on the sidebar.
